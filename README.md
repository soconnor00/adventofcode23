# 2023 Advent Of Code Solutions

These are my solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code problems. I had two primary objectives when writing this code:

- Write readable code
- Learn more about Python

While I also wanted to find the best solutions for each of these problems, I didn't want to spend too much time on any one problem. I have much better things to do with my time than stress over a stupid made-up coding problem. This resulted in me sometimes settling for less performant solutions or borrowing from other solutions.

This approach helped me with my primary objectives more than I expected. I was able to focus on finding the most readable solution instead of the most performant one (most of the time, these were the same thing, but not always). I was also able to focus more on learning about all the tricks and syntactic sugar that Python has to offer.

I probably approached this differently than most people, but by trade I'm a Software Engineer, not a competitive programmer. At work, I write code that other people have to read and maintain, and I wanted to use this to practice writing code that is readable and maintainable.

I hope anyone that comes across this repo is able to read and understand my soloutions. If I missed out on anything that would improve the readability of this code, feel free to open a pull request.

Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
